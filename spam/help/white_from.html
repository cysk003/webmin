<header>Senders to never classify as spam (whitelist_from)</header>

Used to whitelist sender addresses which send mail that is often tagged (incorrectly) as spam. <p>

Use of this setting is not recommended, since it blindly trusts the message, which is routinely and easily forged by spammers and phish senders. <p>

The recommended solution is to instead use whitelist_auth or other authenticated whitelisting methods, or whitelist_from_rcvd. <p>
