<header>Senders to never classify as spam</header>

The <tt>whitelist_from</tt> option is used to whitelist sender addresses which
send mail that is often tagged (incorrectly) as spam. <p>

Use of this setting is not recommended, since it blindly trusts the message,
which is routinely and easily forged by spammers and phish senders. <p>

The recommended solution is to instead use whitelist_auth or other authenticated
whitelisting methods, or <tt>whitelist_from_rcvd</tt>. <p>
